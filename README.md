# hello-world
This is my first repository and a place for ideas to be shared.
I plan to post all kinds of projects on my GitHub. I'm a programmer but I'm also a human being.
I have multiple aliases; Vekktone is my producer name. 
My website that's linked to this GitHub contains mostly musicical projects I've worked on, but also has some podcasts I've produced with fellow colleauges.
Thanks for checking me out(:
